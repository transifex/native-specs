# 3. CDS

[Content Delivery Service](https://docs.transifex.com/transifex-native-sdk-overview/hosting-translations) (CDS) is a web service that retrieves and caches translations from Transifex, in order to later serve them to the Native SDK. It exposes a set of HTTPS endpoints to retrieve and push content or invalidate the cache.

* [3.2 Languages](#32-languages)
* [3.3 Pull content](#33-pull-content)
* [3.4 Push content](#34-push-content)
* [3.5 Invalidate cache](#35-invalidate-cache)

## 3.1 Authentication

Authentication happens through a public project token, that identifies a resource and allows serving of content, and a secret, that can be used for pushing content or other operations that might cause alterations.

All API endpoints authenticate using a Bearer token, provided through an Authorization header:

```bash
# Read-only access to resources
Authorization: Bearer <project-token>

# Read-write access to resources
Authorization: Bearer <project-token>:<secret>
```

## 3.2 Languages

Get a list of languages associated with a content resource.

```bash
GET /languages
Authorization: Bearer <project-token>
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

```bash
### Response body
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "<locale_name>",
      "code": "<locale_code>",
      "localized_name": "<localized_version_of_name>",
      "rtl": <bool>
    },
    { ... }
  ],
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}
```

## 3.3 Pull content

Get localized content for a specific language code.

```bash
GET /content/<lang-code>
Authorization: Bearer <project-token>
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

```bash
### Response body
{
  "data": {
    "<key>": {
      "string": "<string>"
    }
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}
```

## 3.4 Push content

Push source content.

If purge: true in meta object, then replace the entire resource content with the pushed content of this request.

If purge: false in meta object (the default), then append the source content of this request to the existing resource content.

```bash
POST /content
Authorization: Bearer <project-token>:<secret>
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

```bash
### Request body
{
  "data": {
    "<key>": {
      "string": "<source_string>",
      "meta": {
        "context": [<string>, ...]
        "developer_comment": "<string>",
        "character_limit": "<int>",
        "tags": ["<string>", ...],
      }
    }
    "<key>": { ... }
  },
  "meta": {
    "purge": <bool>
  }
}
```

```bash
### Response body
{
  "created": <int>,
  "updated": <int>,
  "skipped": <int>,
  "deleted": <int>,
  "failed": <int>,
  "errors": ["<string>", ...],
}
```

## 3.5 Invalidate cache

Force cache deletion for a specific resource content.

```bash
POST /invalidate
Authorization: Bearer <project-token>
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

### Request body:
```bash
{}
```

```bash
### Response body (success):
{
  "status": 'success',
  "token": "<project_token>",
  "count": <number_of_languages_uncached>,
}
```

### Response body (fail):
```bash
{
  "status": "failed",
}
```
