# 3. Content Delivery Service

[Content Delivery Service](https://developers.transifex.com/docs/content-delivery-service) (CDS) is a web service that retrieves and caches translations from Transifex, in order to later serve them to the Native SDK. It exposes a set of HTTPS endpoints to retrieve and push content or invalidate the cache.

Learn how to exchange content with the CDS API endpoints, by reading the [official README documentation](https://github.com/transifex/transifex-delivery#readme) on Github.
